The Generic DataBase Modeling Tool (GenDBM) uses the MDA approach to provide a database modeling environment for both relational and geographical models.  It also uses the Generic Database Metamodel (GEDBM) which gathers concepts of the most used modeling languages and notations (ER, Crow's Foot, Min-Max, UML, OMT-G, etc.).
